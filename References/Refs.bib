Hierarchical model is aimed at dressing members of a single ensemble (eg. ECMWF), rather than forming a multi-ensemble model. So not really relevant here. Maybe include a mention of this & Roulston in literature review.

Notes that forecast calibration is essentially a by-product of the process - and, importantly, does not require any tuning.

Exploratory plots are given, explaining rationale behind model construction. 
 - again observes consistent (here, positive) bias, suggesting a need for site-specific correction (eg. site-specific regression intercepts)
 - observes linear relationship, with constant slope, between forecast and observation
 - approximately constant variance obsered from boxplots (homoscedasticity across all sites)

Also settles on Gaussian distribution for obs | forecast & parameters, with expectation governed by linear regression and common error variance. (common slope, station-specific intercepts)
Extra hierarchical level for station-specific intercepts, Gaussian given mean intercept & common variance.
Vague priors on mean intercept, intercept variance, common slope, common variance. 

Models were fitted to a moving window of 30 days (no sensitiviity analysis) and compared to best model dressing.},

Nonlinear KF: given model output m, bias y = a + b1 m + b2 m^2 + ... + bn m^n + e
KF will estimate a and b

Good results found with low-order polynomials (order 2-4, authors eventually chose 3 but no particularly pressing difference) - improved on linear KF performance.

Particularly for nonlinear variables such as wind speed, this might make a big difference. But also found improvements over linear KF in surface air temp, which has previously been held up as successful.},

Coefficients are estimated using minimum CRPS estimation.

Lots of useful information on appropriate metrics, why appropriate, etc

Metrics: verification rank histogram; probability integral transform (PIT) histogram CRPS; ignorance score; RMSE. Explains how to compare ensemble forecasts with PDF forecasts, converting between PIT and rank verification histograms.

"Probabilistic forecasts strive to maximise sharpness subject to calibration".

"general estimation strategy: pick a scoring rule that is relevant to the problem at hand, express the score for the training data as a function of the coefficients, and optimize that function with respect to the coefficient values. We take scoring rules to be negatively oriented, so a smaller value is better, and we minimize the training score."},

No post-processing calibration: looking at cyclone strike probability.

Results at 0-5 days:
 - each individual model had +ve BSS: the probabilistic predictions by each SME are statistically useful (compared with climatological predictions)
 - BSS of MCGE also +ve, but smaller than the best SME (which was ECMWF).
 - decomposition of BSS into reliability, resolution & uncertainty gives more nuanced picture. MCGE has reduced sharpness (therefore reduced resolution) but greater reliability, especially in the high-probability range.
 - MCGE also gives reduction in number of missed events.

Results at 3-5 days:
 - only one SME had positive Brier score (ECMWF). MCGEs had larger +ve skill score than this.
 - all SMEs were overconfident (forecast probability larger than observed frequency)

There remain some cases of MCGE bias, beccause all models shared the same bias.},

Working with ocean-atmospheric coupled models

Assessed via spatial anomaly correlation & RMSE. Also categorical forecasts; eg. positive/negative precipitation anomaly. Uses this to obtain Gilbert skill score (= Equitable Threat Score).

For categorical forecast, original superensemble (weighted means?) had best performance. EOF superensemble performs less well in most senses; they put this down to insufficient training, but it may also be that the compressed model space has lost some necessary information.},
